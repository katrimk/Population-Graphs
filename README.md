# Population-Graphs
This project creates a website that allows you to create population graphs using World Bank data. Added 01/2021 after forking: The account it was created in was the one I used for hobby projects before I started my studies. I forked it into this account associated with my current studies, as I intend to use this one as my main account now.

It's based on an online workshop by Sympa, in the form of a MOOC that I completed in April 2020. The course can be accessed here: <a href="https://sympaoy.github.io/webcodingforbeginners/" target="blank">Web Coding for Beginners: Population Graphs</a>

I have done some alterations to the basic code we were required to create, mainly styling the webpage/app with CSS, and adding a footer with HTML. I intend to return to improve it in early 2021, including error-catching and additional functionality with JavaScript now that my coding skills are stronger.

This app isn't currently hosted anywhere, and I've only been accessing it locally, but I might put it online later.
